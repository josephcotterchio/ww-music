The app is meant for any non-hipster web dev. You can add in all of the products you want to buy or re-buy. Or just things you find later that are of interest.

After a long day, it's an easy way to save your favourite, weed, wine, and music. What every web dev needs.

<strong>Technologies Used</strong>

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* React.js
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* GitHub
* Git
* Heroku

<strong>Roadblocks</strong>
* Implementing the main viable product for the project was done relatively quickly. But trying to implement the user stories ran into issues of being able to incorporate those changes in a MERN stack in a week became impossible. Due to the heirarchical nature of React, days were spent trying to code the database, controllers, models, routes, components and pages. In doing so, it risked losing that main viable product. Working on a branch of the main work, I attempted to add in additional functionality. The timelines simply didn't allow for those user stories to be added.


<strong>Future Enhancements</strong>

* Adding a 3rd-party API so that users can search maps for locations, or stores, near them, place online orders, and Spotify so that they can listen to music while they do.
* Adding the functionality so that users can upload images of products they like (making it eaiser to remember).
* Implementing SCSS for a better UX experience.
